\textbf{Introduction} \par
The \textbf{Tracking System} is a multipurpose tracking system which can help in tracking the data on a computer.This can be used in various ways like History based tracking in case the user had an important work that he would want to remember each step done for offline working routine, or in case of an organization to supervise the work of its employees. When the soft is initialized it opens up in offline mode and has interface methods to extend to an online mode which can add the IDâ€™s of the other users in order to create an Admin Supervisor.The Admin supervisor has control over all the options in whole group. The Interface of the Tracking system contains various additional options in order to be able to create new tracking methods and filter the final data in form of Report for a filtered method.
The filtered method can create or import methods for data filtering. The tracking methods can be chosen in a checkbox form.The default tracking methods will contain Keyboard type tracking,Mouse tracking,Upload/Download data track and a low quality(for fast data transmition) screenshot during a chosen time interval and/or activity.More tracking methods can be further added in the system, in of themselves the tracking methods are mini systems made to work on specific tasks.
