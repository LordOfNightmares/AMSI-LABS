In this course work i learned how to setup and application project ,how to describe it using Unified Modeling Language ,what an application project needs in order to be understood by the team members and how to manage the project in order to implement the idea behind it.In my course work i provided a standard design of my Application but as far as i don't start building it in real life i can't provide all the small details about it,therefor this project just interprets the base idea of how my application should work look and how it communicates with devices.
