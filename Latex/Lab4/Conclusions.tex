In this laboratory work i learned how to create Collaboration Diagrams which resemble a flowchart that portrays the roles, functionality and behavior of individual objects as well as the overall operation of the system in real time.
Another purpose of  Collaboration Diagrams diagrams is to show a more compact Sequence diagram that doesn't show the time component.
